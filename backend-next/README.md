# Getting Started
## Steps
build and run the backend

`cargo build`

run the dev server

`cargo run`

## To configure the db
I'm lazy, so just copy the migrations initial sql file from `migrations/0000-initial.sql` and run it in whatever db manager you're using

data migration script doesn't work anymore so don't even try it lol, api no longer exists

just manually add data for now, I'm too lazy to make an api for that.
